# Roadmap-Projects
Collection of my projects from https://roadmap.sh/ 

Feeling stuck on helpdesk.

Found and interest in creating things from scratch and realised I'm not going to create the next big app/software product.
This takes that desire to create in a format I understand and enjoy.

I'm doing this outside of my full-time work hours because I am passionate and want more from what I am doing.
No point feeling stagnant - might aswell do something about it. 

So here I am, step-by-step, project-by-project, attempting to keep moving along.
